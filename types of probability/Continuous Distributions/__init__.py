- Continuous Distributions: in python  (CDF) refers to Continuous Distribution Function,
and (pdf) refers to Probability Distribution Function.

- (range of possible values)

- Probability distributions where the random variable can take any value within a specified range.
- Examples include the normal (Gaussian), uniform, exponential, beta, gamma, and Weibull distributions.


1. **Uniform Distribution:**
   - **Idea:** Every point in the range is equally likely.
   - **Example:** Picking a random number between 0 and 1.

2. **Normal (Gaussian) Distribution:**
   - **Idea:** Forms a symmetrical bell curve with a defined mean and standard deviation.
   - **Example:** Distribution of human heights or weights.

3. **Exponential Distribution:**
   - **Idea:** Describes the time between events in a Poisson process.
   - **Example:** Time between arrivals of consecutive customers at a store.

4. **Gamma Distribution:**
   - **Idea:** Generalization of the exponential distribution, often used for time until a specified event.
   - **Example:** Time until the next phone call in a call center.

5. **Beta Distribution:**
   - **Idea:** Describes the distribution of probabilities for events with two outcomes.
   - **Example:** Modeling the distribution of success probabilities in a continuous context.
