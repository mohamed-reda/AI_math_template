Discrete Distributions:

like (coin flips, dice rolls, etc.)
Probability distributions where the random variable can only take distinct, separate values.
Examples include the Bernoulli, binomial, Poisson, geometric, hypergeometric, and multinomial distributions.

1. **Bernoulli Distribution:**
   - **Idea:** Models a single trial with two possible outcomes (success or failure).
   - **Example:** Flipping a coin (Heads or Tails).

2. **Binomial Distribution:**
   - **Idea:** Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.
   - **Example:** Counting the number of heads in five coin flips.

3. **Poisson Distribution:**
   - **Idea:** Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.
   - **Example:** Counting the number of emails received in an hour.

4. **Geometric Distribution:**
   - **Idea:** Describes the number of trials needed for the first success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials.
   - **Example:** Finding the number of coin flips needed to get the first Heads.

5. **Hypergeometric Distribution:**
   - **Idea:** Describes the number of successes in a sample drawn without replacement from a finite population.
   - **Example:** Drawing cards from a deck without replacement, counting the number of red cards.

6. **Negative Binomial Distribution:**
   - **Idea:** Generalization of the geometric distribution, describes the number of trials needed for a specified number of successes.
   - **Example:** Counting the number of coin flips needed to get three Heads.

7. **Multinomial Distribution:**
   - **Idea:** Generalization of the binomial distribution for more than two categories.
   - **Example:** Rolling a fair six-sided die multiple times, counting the occurrences of each number.

8. **Categorical Distribution:**
   - **Idea:** Describes the probability of observing each category in a set.
   - **Example:** Predicting the category of an image (e.g., cat, dog, or bird).

9. **Discrete Uniform Distribution:**
   - **Idea:** Every outcome in a finite set is equally likely.
   - **Example:** Rolling a fair die.
